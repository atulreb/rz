                                                <p>None of our work is subcontracted out, its all done by employees who pass our rigorous training program and ongoing monthly skill building training we do with them. We also background check and drug test all employees so you can feel save and secure when we are working on your property.</p>
                                                <p>Our main company goal in 2016 is to build a company culture of success and amazing customer service. We have set a goal with our painters in Tucson and Phoenix to reach over 500 5-Star reviews in 2016 and we believe that we have the right guys in place to reach that goal.</p>
