<h3><strong>Service Details and Information:</strong></h3>

<p>We manage the entire outside of your home searching for pests such as ants, spiders, wasps, etc., in addition to looking for signs of rodents and termites.  This part of the General Pest Service is extremely important and something we take very seriously. We take care of the entire exterior of your home to protect against insects who are looking for a way in.  MAYCO Pest &amp; Termite Control's interior service includes treating your plumbing areas, underneath appliances and big pieces of furniture, windows, doors, and corners because we know this is where bugs like to enter the home and where they like to hide.  We treat each accessible room in your home, including your garage and an easily accessible attic to ensure that these areas are free of insect infestation.</p>

<p>The <a href="../service-areas.html">General Pest Service</a> is highly recommended to be used as a preventative service, as opposed to a resolution service. While it is still effective as a resolution, our main goal is to prevent insects from getting inside in the first place. Pests are always searching for places to live that offer food, shelter, water and an acceptable climate in order to sustain life and breed more pests. As insects forage into your home and cross a treated barrier, they are eliminated preventing reproduction and major infestations.  Make sure to <a href="../get-free-estimate.html">stop the problem before it starts</a>.  This service is the best preventative maintenance there is.</p>

<p>Our Customized Plan is perfect for clients who have pest problems that can be taken care of in one or two services without routinely scheduled appointments like bee nests, rodents, and bed bugs.  Please contact us for a complete list of customized plans. Limited <a href="../about-us/warranty.html">warranty</a> included.</p>
