	<p>There are several different types of termites that are active year-round, although termite swarmer’s are normally seen during the months of March and April and are usually noticed during daylight hours.  The presence of termites inside your home, or visible on the foundation, generally means a professional treatment is necessary to eliminate the colony and prevent damage to the home or structure.  There are multiple options for treating existing termites and preventing future infestations.</p>

<h2 style="clear:left;">Preventative Termite Protection</h2>

<p>Our RazorClean Termite Prevention Plan provides year-round protection through all 4 seasons from termites. With this plan, we will install monitoring stations around the perimeter of your home, which are designed to both attract termites and eliminate the colony before they ever reach your home.  On your routine quarterly visits we will inspect each station for termite activity as well as the exterior of your home.  If termites are ever found on your home, we will spot treat the problem at no charge. Warranty is included.</p>

<p>Our RazorClean Liquid Barrier Treatment Plan is a stand-alone plan. We will dig a trench around the perimeter of your foundation and inject termiticide into the soil.  This protective barrier around your home or business prevents any termite growth and damage for several years. This Protection Plan is perfect for clients who need peace of mind from termites and do not want to have routinely scheduled appointments. 1-year warranty is included.  The warranty can be renewed each year with an inspection at an additional cost.</p>
