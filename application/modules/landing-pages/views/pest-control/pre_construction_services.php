One of the most effective ways to prevent termites and other wood destroying insects from nesting in your home or building is to have it treated during construction by RazorClean Termite & Pest Control. There are two ways of doing this.  One is to have the soil treated right before the foundation is poured.  Applying the treatment this way can ensure that the problem is completely gone before it begins on not only the soil below, but the entire building. Another option is to have a borate treatment performed on all the studs at the "dried in" stage.  This product soaks into each stud and protects all the wood for years to come from all wood-destroying insects.  On top of preventing termites that are ready to invade your structure, this treatment is typically much cheaper than preventing the problem after it has begun. When doing additions to existing homes, it is a good idea to have a treatment done during construction because termites will inhabit the new area where the old and new foundations meet.
