Rodents are perhaps the dirtiest pest of them all. They leave droppings everywhere. They chew through wires, cables and all sorts of material. Rodents also have no bladder control, so they leave urine and urine stains wherever they travel.</p>

                                                    <p>Placing traps isn't enough to control these pests. The entry points need to be sealed so they cannot continue to access your home, garage, or attic.  While you may only see one rat, there is usually an infestation. Don't take on an entire colony of rodents on your own. Bites and scratches can spread diseases. Contact RazorClean Termite & Pest Control for help!</p>

                                                    <p>While poisoning rodents is a possibility, the real solution is to keep them from being able to enter your home or business. Professional traps, baits, and techniques are the only way to ensure your home and family is safe so the rodents do not continue to come back and cause problems.</p>
