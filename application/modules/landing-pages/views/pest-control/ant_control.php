Knowing what type of ant you are fighting is the key if you want them gone, which is why RazorClean is here to help.
Ants are one of the most difficult household pests to eliminate unless provided with the proper tools, experience, and guidance. Some ants live in holes or small enclosures and are best controlled using dust products while other ants are best controlled with baits.  Many times they seek proteins or sweeter substances which can be from spilled sugary drinks or dropped food. Choosing the right product and knowing where to place it to best eliminate the issue is what our professionals are here to do.</p>


<p>Sometimes, ants can be extra pesky and can share homes even if they're different types of ants.
