<p>There are two main types of bed bug treatments, chemical and heat.  The problem with a chemical treatment is that you are relying on every bed bug to come out of their hiding place and pass through the product, including babies that need to hatch from their nest.  If even one female remains alive, you will continue to have the same problem.  At RazorClean Termite & Pest Control we perform heat treatments, which is the fastest and most effective method.  A heat treatment, along with special equipment, ensures the heat penetrates every area of your home or room, including all their hiding places.  Some people have concerns about this type of treatment damaging their furniture or other things in their home.  Rest assured, it doesn't get hot enough to damage your things and if there are items in the home that are at risk, we will let you know.  You can be confident that when RazorClean Termite & Pest Control does the treatment, it will be done the right way the first time and you can feel safe in your home again.</p>
