                                                    <h2>Understanding Termites</h2>

                                                    <p style="overflow: auto;">These home invaders actually serve a purpose in nature. They digest wood and other cellulose material, breaking down dead trees and vegetation. That's great - until the cellulose they try to break down is part of your home. Then it's time for action.</p>

                                                    <h2><strong>Types of Termites </strong></h2>

                                                    <p>There are several types of termites in the United States to be concerned with including Dampwood, Drywood, Formosan, Cone Head, Desert, and Subterranean. The most common is a Subterranean termite which build colonies underground. This type of termite needs contact with the soil to maintain their moisture levels. A regular source of moisture is critical to a subterranean colony’s survival.</p>

                                                    <p>Termites are social insects who live in colonies with specific roles. There are workers, soldiers, reproductives and even queens. As a colony matures, it may release winged males and females – or "swarmers. If they survive, swarmers will settle, shed their wings and form a new colony.</p>
