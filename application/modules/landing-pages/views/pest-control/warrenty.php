<h2>Pest Control Warranty</h2>

<p>Here at RazorClean Termite & Pest Control, we provide warranties on all our work. Additionally, optional warranties are available for certain treatments if you want to have greater peace of mind with the pest control treatment you have just received.  It’s important to have a warranty, so that you don’t have to pay out of pocket if you ever experience a re-infestation. </p>

<h3>Termite Treatment Warranties</h3>

<p>Because termites are both costly and destructive to your home, it may come as a relief to know that RazorClean Termite & Pest Control will warranty all of the termite treatments we perform – yes, including spot treatments for one year!</p>

<p>An additional warranty is available on an annual basis to provide you with years of termite treatment warranty coverage. Which policy you choose should depend on the age of your home and the severity of your previous termite infestation. Please know that annual termite inspections are required for warranties extending beyond one year.
</p>
