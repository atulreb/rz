I’m originally from Kansas City, Missouri. Growing up, my father was a general contractor and I remember going to his work sites with him where I’d try my hand at building things like dog houses and bird houses. It was clear, early on, that I had a passion for construction and remodeling. I guess I learned a thing or two over the years. Punch List was born. Along with my wife and two young children, we now reside, go to school in the Lakeview area and support local Chicago businesses.</p>
                    <p>We find that most people can easily make a list of at least 10 items around their home or office in need of repair. With <strong>Punch List</strong>, there is no need to hire multiple contractors. Our skilled craftsmen provide full, end-to-end service. In a timely fashion, we address your needs, knock each and every item off of your punch-list and get you back to enjoying your home.</p>

Appliances, finishes--even colors--in a kitchen design can easily be linked quite inextricably to a specific decade's trends and styles.
